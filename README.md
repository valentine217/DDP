Data developing products practice code

Here, you find the two files ui.R and server.R corresponding to my first shiny app. Please, try this APP in the following link:

This APP provides you a prediction for the results of the matches for Spanish soccer team during the next World Cup to be held in Brazil. In this APP you intro in the box the prediction goals of the Spanish team rival, and the application returns you a number with the prediction of the Goals for Spanih team and a graph to visualize the final result. My theory, very well supported by complex statistical models learned in this Coursera Specialization,... but not for the reality,... is that Spain always get three goals more than his rival. Enjoy it!!!. :)))
